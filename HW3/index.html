            <h3>My Career Journey</h3>
            <p>My name is Gary Anderson.  I was born and raised in 
            Cleveland, Ohio where I still reside today.  I've worked 
            mainly in the banking industry for all of my career.  
            With the <span class="bold_para_text">Financial Crisis of 2008</span>, the financial services 
            industry was greatly impacted making it challenging to 
            maintain job security.  <br /><br />We're also seeing the increase of 
            <span class="bold_para_text">Artificial Intelligence (AI) and automation</span> 
            shift the <span class="bold_para_text">job market</span> 
            from traditional labor jobs to more technical ones.  
            It's imperative that one adopt a lifelong commitment 
            to learning to combat these shifts.
            </p>

            <p>Throughout my career I demonstrated a novice understanding 
            of coding through end user computing within Microsoft Office products.  
            I started researching computer programming as a way to increase 
            my technical skills.  <br /><br />I came across a program at 
            Cuyahoga Community College called <span class="bold_para_text">Cleveland Codes</span>.  
            It's a five-day-per-week, 16 hour-per-day course where you can 
            earn a computer programming certification.

            <h3>Education</h3>
            <p>I have a <span class="bold_para_text">Bachelors Degree in Business</span> from <span class="bold_para_text">Cleveland State University</span> where I <span class="bold_para_text">majored in Finance</span>.  I received my <span class="bold_para_text">Graduate Degree in Business</span> from <span class="bold_para_text">Indiana Wesleyan University</span>.  I'm currently attending <span class="bold_para_text">Cuyahoga Community College</span>.    
            </p>
    
            <h3>Experience</h3>
            <p>I've worked in <span class="bold_para_text">Mortgage Banking</span> for almost 19 years mainly as a <span class="bold_para_text">Financial Reporting Analyst</span>.  I specialized in production and profitability statistics on the origination side of the mortgage business.  My strengths revolve around <span class="bold_para_text">querying data warehouses</span>, producing <span class="bold_para_text">management reports</span>, and <span class="bold_para_text">streamlining and automating report processes</span> from an end user perspective.
            </p>
    
            <h1>Accomplishments</h1>
            <h3>Data Expertise</h3>
            <p>Being the author of <span class="bold_para_text">production statistics</span> for the Mortgage Division of the company where the totals I derived were published in the <span class="bold_para_text">company financials</span> and <span class="bold_para_text">peer group surveys</span>, and was used for <span class="bold_para_text">licensing and regulatory audits</span>.</p>
    
            <h3>Data Integrity</h3>
            <p>Completely overhauled the report process used to report application volume to the <span class="bold_para_text">Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA)</span> that was in place before I started working for the company.  After extensive research and testing, discovered erroneous data being reported and data being missed due to business process changes, timing, and outdated logic.  <br /><br />As a result of the changes I implemented, produced a more accurate data set that didn't change over time and could be reconciled when looking back.  This allowed for more accurate <span class="bold_para_text">industry data forecasts</span> which impacts budgeting.</p>
    
            <h3>Sales Metrics</h3>
            <p>Created and maintained a process that switched the <span class="bold_para_text">Sales Incentive Methodology</span> from being <span class="bold_para_text">profitability-based</span> to being <span class="bold_para_text">volume-driven</span> that incentivized for not only the amount of business a client was bringing in but also how many new clients with business were coming on board.</p>

            <h3>Automation</h3>
            <p>Created an end-user <span class="bold_para_text">overnight batch job</span> process using <span class="bold_para_text">Microsoft Access and Excel</span> where numerous daily reports would run automatically updating with new production and available before the start of business.</p>

            <h3>Watching Movies</h3>
            <p>I tend to be somewhat of a home-body, so I like spending time at home relaxing with my family.  One of my favorite hobbies is watching movies.  I'm mainly interested in home theater.  <br /><br />Not just turning on Netflix or popping in a DVD, but rather more of the high-definition audio/video content only found in Blu-Ray discs or higher quality discs.  <br /><br />Even though content may be marked as high-definition (HD) in streaming applications, I've found that the only way to not only get the higher quality picture but also the higher quality sound is to play a disc.  And the sound is what intrigues me the most.    
            </p>
    
            <h3>Home Theater</h3>
            <p>Over the years I've been able to overhaul old speakers that I kept since I was a teenager and make some electronics add-ons and upgrades to yield a decent sounding home system on an average family-man's budget.  I really get into the movie special effects especially when sight and sound are matched together well.  <br /><br />I must admit, this means that I often watch movies more for the special effects than the plot or quality of the acting.  I end up watching a lot of superhero movies because there are plenty of them out there now and they all tend to be geared up more with special effects.  I really get into the sound though.
            </p>
    
            <p>What am I referring to when it comes to the sound?  Well, I like the <span class="bold_para_text">bass</span> produced by HD tracks.  It's called the <span class="bold_para_text">Low Frequency Effect (LFE)</span>.  It's the deep and sometimes subsonic sound of the movie track.  This creates the low rumbles of explosions, earthquakes, dinosaur stomps, etc. - you get the drift.  <br /><br />So it's not just what's heard but what's felt to give a realistic experience.  This is the type of sound that can only be achieved through HD movie tracks that are specifically engineered that way in the studio for a surround sound audio system - or a system with multiple speakers with each playing a specific role but all working together in tandem.  <br /><br />Aside from the bass, a good surround sound system in all areas is needed to optimize the sound quality.  For example, a scene from a jungle on a good surround sound system will make it seem like the animal sounds are all around you as if you're in the movie.  The same with the sound of a ricochet or a helicopter passing.</p>

            <h3>Favorite Movie</h3>
            <p>My favorite movie so far is a movie called <span class="bold_para_text">Interstellar</span>.  It's a movie about interstellar space travel which appeals to my childhood interests.  I've always been interested in space and the cosmos in general since I was a kid.  <br /><br />If I could do it all over again I would be an astronomer or astrophysicist.  The movie explores <span class="bold_para_text">Einstein's Theory of Relativity</span> in graphic detail.  The special effects are top notch and look and sound realistic.  <br /><br />There're some amazing scenes where they travel through a <span class="bold_para_text">worm hole</span> and eventually a <span class="bold_para_text">black hole</span>.  Not only that, but the plot is really thought-provoking and in some ways mind-blowing.  A very intelligent movie in my opinion.</p>
